# Gravi-Simulation
My college project of simulating work of gravitation on really massive objects of our universe. I'm gonna use C++, OpenGL (GLFW3, GLAD and GLM) and QT for UI. For compiler i use mingw and for IDE - CLion (cause i can)


**NECESSARY CHANGES**
>1. Change calculations for Gravity Force (use more efficient method).
>2. Make calculations, when it needed.
>3. Add actual modes to camera. 
>4. Do something with *inactiveObjects*, like delete them or reuse
>5. Fix trails.
>6. Make more variants for collision.
>7. Create shaders files, because I want to make main.cpp cleanlier.
>8. Make functions for rendering (main loop should be cleanlier than that shit).

All these changes i will make during actual education in college (I was on a technological internship[wtf is this word, I didn't see it anywhere]). I must make two more projects, but this simulation will stay as my main goal to finish.
