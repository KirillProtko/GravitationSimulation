# Gravi-Simulation
My college project of simulating work of gravitation on really massive objects of our universe. I'm gonna use C++, OpenGL (GLFW3, GLAD and GLM) and QT for UI. For compiler i use mingw and for IDE - CLion (cause i can)

I accidentally spilled tea on my laptop. So i had to use old HP laptop with Intel Core i5 6100 and 12GB of RAM (that more than my main laptop lol), and during this i HAD to switch to something like Visual Studio Code or even Vim (that really will be interesting, so maybe someday).
